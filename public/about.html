        <h2>Visualizing Hospital Charges & Payments By Medicare - Inpatient Data</h2>
        <hr/>
        <p>This interactive visualization uses a Top down approach to explore how charges and actual payments vary across US hospital for top 100 DRGs(Diagnostic Related Group). It is composed of the folllowing
          3 charts to achieve that.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Hexbin Chart(Heatmap)<li>
            <p>This chart shows the distribution/density of the chose DRG. Not only can users see range of the charges/payments across US for same DRG, but they can also see
              where most hospitals cluster towards. Selection/Brushing of a particular subset of range allows users to narrow down criteria for Avg charges and Payments and see which hospitals/regions 
              get paid more by Medicare for same exact range of Charges and vice versa.
            </p>
          <li>Geo-Map</li>
            <p>This maps all relevant providers to currently selected DRG on US map. When user changes selection in Hexbin chart, it updates this map accordingly by only showing those providers
               that meet the criteria. The sidebar section shows most expensive and least expensive proviers within the currently selected criteria. Hovering over a provider bubble in map displays
               some info about it(like name, location, charges, payments and number of discharges).
