Notes from webinar - June 18
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
target audience - broad, general public, communities...not just data scientists or policy makers
only avg payments available, not median, max and other stats(they are available for purchase)
more detailed/broken out dataset available in purchase, but it cant be used for this challenge
can use either one or the other, or both inpatient/outpatient dataset, not a requirement that both has to be used
inpatient dataset is somewhat bigger

purchasable data - procedures done, discharge details, costs, for every single case in that hospital
provided data - rolled up, average dataset
using a purchased dataset is not an advantage of any kind

can final app be opensourced?
- depends on case by case basis

Inpatient data - 163k total records


Points from the Time article 
- chargemanager - internal pricelist maintained by each hospital(usually way too high for everything, staring point for negotions)
- medicate pays a fraction of actual bill, but still profitable for hospitals
- ceo and other executives make ton of salary(usually in order of millions) even for non-profit hospitals
- about 2k non-profit hospitals in US and 1k for-profit
- lawyers file law suits against doctors, so they over do(use more tests) and thus earn more profits for hospitals(they can't be sued for doing more tests)
- lot more usage of CT scans, MRIs and other expensive procedures in US compared to other countries(doctors are trigger happy to do it)
- bill negotiation is a lucrative business(typical $100/hr)
- medical devices companies give grants/fellowships/money to doctors, so each doctor has their own prefernce for some machine
- hospitals spend 5-10 times more in lobby money than say defense in last 10 years
How to fix some of these:
- lower medicare eligibility age
- tax 75% of profits(now its 0%)
- more accountability/transparancy for hospitals(get rid of laws that prohibit transparancies)
- get rid of chargemanager

Own research
- not much social signal/interaction about hospitals(ppl don't complain to hospitals like they normally about airles/flights/hotels and other businesses)
- patient reviews available on medicare.gov

Stats:
standard deviation, variance of charges for single DRG


Viz Ideas:
- Bubble chart w/wo force layout, grid lines sections
- Questions to ask/see: expore by DRG, by state, by individual hospitals
- compare with overall cost of living(if available)
- similarity index(visually show which hospitals/charges are similar) vs dissimilarity index
